Simple script im using to clean up zone files for use with Bind


BUGS:

sub zones are created with out NS records...
	they should be the same as the main zones
	would need to loop through the main data looking for type=NS
	Maybe i should be sticking then in a header  data tree instead

When  trying to created  a sub zone if the sub zone has a CNAME pointing to it 
	we can not create it, as you can not have a CNAME as the source of a zone

I have also created extra scripts for diffrent zone types "parse_exported_zone-reverse.pl  parse_exported_zone-sort-by-first.pl "
Should make this an option instead of being lazzy
